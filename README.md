# Library-Database-Search
GUI that allows a user to search through a built-in database of books as though they are at a library.

Contains a built-in, open-source database of books, loaded into the application as a SQLite database. The program builds a SQL query based on the user's input for any combination of the 9 search categories and returns all relevant results. These results can then be exported to a Microsoft Excel CSV in a destination of the user's choosing.
